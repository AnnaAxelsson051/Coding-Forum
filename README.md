## Description

A user-friendly web forum built with ASP.NET and Razor featuring hard-coded coding discussion topics, allowing users to participate in various subjects. Upon selecting a topic users are presented with a list of all threads under that topic, additionally there's an option to create a new thread. Clicking on a thread lets users view its content and the associated responses. Users can also contribute by adding their response. The project follows the MVC design pattern and maintains a strict separation of concerns, and efficient use of view-models for data that's passed to and from the views. All user inputs are validated to prevent erroneous or malicious data entries.
